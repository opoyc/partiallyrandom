abstract = {Experimental economics represents a strong growth industry. In the past several decades the method has expanded beyond intellectual curiosity, now merit- ing consideration alongside the other more traditional empirical approaches used in economics. Accompanying this growth is an influx of new experimenters who are in need of straightforward direction to make their designs more powerful. This study provides several simple rules of thumb that researchers can apply to improve the effi- ciency of their experimental designs.We buttress these points by including empirical examples from the literature.
