      <description>A couple of weeks ago we had hour yearly Ph.D. workshop in which we present our project development. I’ve always moral sentiments around my duties regarding what someone like me who received a grant should do. One of these moral burdens is to assist to every single presentation and try to provide useful feedback.
Long story short, a fellow Ph.D. student presented a draft of a experimental design. Aligned with my principles, I suggested her to be more humble regarding what she wanted to test, since there were far too many hypotheses she wanted to test for (i.</description>

      <description>This function tries to visualize the frequentist perspective of probability by flipping an equilibrated π(θ)=0.5 coin.
Frequentist approach establish that the true probability of an event θ is given by:
\[ \pi(\theta_i)=\lim_{\theta_i\to\infty} \frac{n_{\theta\_i}}{n_{trials,i}} \]
# obs is the number of times a coin is flipped # coins are the number of indepedent coins tossed at the same time f.coin=function(flips, coins){ plot(x = 0 , ylab = &amp;quot;Probability&amp;quot; , xlab = &amp;quot;Times&amp;quot; , main = paste(&amp;quot;Flipping&amp;quot;, coins, &amp;quot;indepedent coins&amp;quot;, flips, &amp;quot;times&amp;quot;) , type = &amp;quot;n&amp;quot;, ylim = c(0, 1), xlim = c(0, flips)) abline(h = .</description>
