      <description>Javier is visiting me for a couple of days here in Barcelona. This silly guy is trying to measure the relation between social media representativeness and expectations of qualifying in the group phase of the World Cup. It seems that he is collecting the information going from page to pageâ€¦ I as a benevolent friend create a classic scraping function to make his life easier (maybe it can make your life better as well)</description>

      <description>Oftenly I have to deal with modifications of a scraping code, whose outcomes change or are subject to errors. Hence, I found useful to have a way to create versions of a data frame, this is a made savts.
This simple yet useful function creates csv file with time stamp. It saves a data frame in the working directory as a csv file, separated by semicolon with a date and system time (format %d%m%y_%H%M).</description>
