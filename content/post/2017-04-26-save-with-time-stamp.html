<p>Oftenly I have to deal with modifications of a scraping code, whose outcomes change or are subject to errors. Hence, I found useful to have a way to create versions of a data frame, this is a made <code>savts</code>.</p>
<p>This simple yet useful function creates csv file with time stamp. It saves a data frame in the working directory as a csv file, separated by semicolon with a date and system time (format <code>%d%m%y_%H%M</code>).</p>
<pre><code>savts = function(x) {
  write.csv2(x, paste(getwd(), &quot;/&quot;, deparse(substitute(x)), &quot;-&quot;, format(Sys.time(),
    &quot;%d%m%y_%H%M&quot;), &quot;.csv&quot;, sep = &quot;&quot;), row.names = FALSE)
}</code></pre>
