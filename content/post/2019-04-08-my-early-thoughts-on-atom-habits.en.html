<p>The past weekend I started to read Atomic Habits by James Clear, it has been quite nice so far, but I mean, after checking out several articles on behavior-related issues and decision making, there is little margin for a surprise. Nonetheless, there is one thing I believe the author did it right, which simplifies concepts (not entirely an easy task).</p>

<p>Among the first ideas James Clear try to convince the reader is to forget about the goals and concentrate the effort on what he called <em>system</em>, which is nothing else than a set of articulated intermediate goals whatsoever, but in the end, goals…</p>
<p>I am aware of the need to use or (re)create new concepts since <em>sophisticated</em> readers might think there is no reason to read a book which statements are just rephrasing of old books. For instance, the feedback loop of habits’ modification is given as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[cue \to craving \to response \to reward \to cue \to \dots\]</span></p>
<p>My cringe moment occurred when I read what is <em>craving</em>, defined as <em>“the motivational force behind every habit”</em>, hmm well those are the old <em>desires</em>? Come on… Not a big deal, maybe today I just too judgemental.</p>
